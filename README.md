+# Hello World!
I am Armanch the Archman. I don't care about what you do with this program, unless you try to sell it.
### I guess I'll just explain myself in this project.
I am Arman√ß and I am an absolute maniac (i use arch btw) who is interested in calculus and computer science and I hate python for some reason. 
I'm a C/C++ fan 'cause why not??
I like music but my headphone's right jack has been cracked rn (I literally put my feet on it).
But i still use it (thanks to me being a bass fan).
My biggest dream is making Linux n1 in this unfair world where people like me suffer a 4GB DDR3 ram while some people throw RTX 4090s like flexing to "people" while they actually don't now anything about computers but stealing money.
This is me. A big brain in a small head. (Also i gave this hello world program more time than you think (bruh)).
You have all rights to do anything with this repository expect selling it. (Why would you sell tho)
